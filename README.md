- 😄 Pronouns: These are words used to describe nouns (person, place, or thing), and can be very helepful in describing and identifying them.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Chevrolet designer Etienne Planche copied a cool looking bowtie from the wallpaper in his hotel room in France while visiting family there. In 1914, he submitted the bowtie design to the board for use on their upcoming truck as the logo for the grill. That bowtie is the same logo, aleit with minor changes over the years, that Chevrolet uses today on all of their vehicles.
